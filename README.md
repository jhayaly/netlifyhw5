# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with Hot Module Reloading (HMR) and some ESLint rules, including the CIS-1962 ESLint rules.

# Development

To get started, first run `npm i` to install dependencies.

To start a development server, run:

```sh
npm run dev
```

To make a production build, run:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` folder with all your static files ready to serve.
